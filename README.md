# Spaced Repetition Agenda

This project is a personal learning challenge created to explore the design of a spaced repetition system.  
The goal is to build a clean, efficient, and fully functional agenda from scratch â€” with a strong focus on structure, maintainability, and future app development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

I started this project during my first year of Computer Science at Parthenope University (Naples) to:

- Reinforce my understanding of C++ and software architecture
- Apply what I've learned in a real, structured context
- Build a foundation for a future **mobile app** focused on spaced repetition
- Practice rewriting code from scratch in a clean and modern way

---

## ðŸš§ Status

The current repository serves as a **restart point**.  
All existing code will be rewritten with clearer structure, better naming, and full English documentation.

## ðŸ“± Future Plans

- Android version of the agenda
- GUI interface
- Daily task notifications
- Cloud sync
